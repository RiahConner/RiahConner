## 🌞 Hi there 

I'm currently pursuing a BS in Graphic Information Technology with a focus in Full-Stack Web Development. After graduation, I aim to build cognitive architectures and tools that support research, self-development, and legacy preservation. 

There is something deeply satisfying about building things, solving problems, and watching ideas come to life through code. My current focus is on learning and using C#, HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. 

Outside of tech, I enjoy Genealogy 🧬, Heraldry 🛡️, and embroidery 🧵.
